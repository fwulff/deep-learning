## Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.

Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with Keras and TensorFlow; perform sentiment analysis and generate new text. Use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts.
